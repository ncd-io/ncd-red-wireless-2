This library handles communication to, and configuration of, the [NCD Wireless Sensor Line](https://ncd.io/wireless-enterprise-line/). It can be used in [conjunction with Node-RED](https://ncd.io/node-red-wireless-sensors/) to create and manage a Wireless Sensor Network using the Node-RED flow-based development tool on any platform. For specific examples of different sensor types using this package, check out the resources tab of the [appropriate product page](https://store.ncd.io/?fwp_main_facet=enterprise-solutions). If you cannot find an example, or need further assistance, check out the [Node-RED section of our forum](https://community.ncd.io/c/node-red).
